(** [cmp_set_like_lists lst1 lst2] compares two lists to see whether
    they are equivalent set-like lists.  That means checking two things.
    First, they must both be {i set-like}, meaning that they do not
    contain any duplicates.  Second, they must contain the same elements,
    though not necessarily in the same order. *)
